I use a couple of laptops in my day-to-day activities. This is always a hassle, as I'm switching contexts, logins, and hardware multiple times per day. To reduce friction I decided to write down some notes about my laptop setup. This is mainly for me to re-use in the future, but I figured this might help others in similar situations.

## Browser: Firefox

I use Firefox for web browsing, mainly due to its Container Tab feature and Mozilla's focus on privacy.
Important for: isolating different areas of my life on any machine using container tabs. I currently use three containers: personal, work 1 (my employer), and work 2 (current client).
Add-ons:
[1Password](https://1password.com/) as Password Manager
[Roam Toolkit](https://github.com/roam-unofficial/roam-toolkit/) for my Note-taking Application
[HTTPS Everywhere](https://addons.mozilla.org/nl/firefox/addon/https-everywhere/) to force secure connections
[Instapaper ](https://www.instapaper.com/)for my Bookmarking Application
[Symantec Authentication Client Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/nl/firefox/addon/symantec-mpkic-extension/) to connect to my work accounts
[uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/nl/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) for blocking intrusive ads

## Password Manager: 1Password

There are numerous options out there for password managers. I opted for 1Password because it has cross-platform support for all my devices.

## Note-taking application

I use Roam Research, which is much more than a simple note-taking app. It's marketed as a 'tool for networked thought', and I absolutely love it. Notes in Roam are free-form, and you can interconnect any thought using the amazing bi-directional linking feature. I do most of my note-taking, thinking, researching and writing in Roam.
I also use Drafts for quick notes while I cannot access Roam. I found [this neat Drafts Action](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/162) to quickly export notes to Roam.

## Application Launcher

While both MacOS and Windows offer decent app launchers, I wanted a bit more functionality. I use Alfred on MacOS, and the open-source Keypirinha on Windows.

## Text Replacement

I previously used [TextExpander](https://textexpander.com/), which is a great but somewhat pricy tool.
Recently I started using [PhraseExpress](https://www.phraseexpress.com/), which is free for personal use and offers the same features as TextExpander. PhraseExpress also has a portable version, which is great for my locked-in work laptops.

## Window Management

After upgrading to a new ultrawide monitor at home, I quickly realized that the standard window management features in MacOS and Windows are too limited. Windows' Snap features are better, and will get proper poweruser functionality once PowerToys FancyZones gets integrates. In the meantime I'll stick to [Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/) on MacOS and [Gridy](https://sector-seven.com/software/gridy) on Windows.

## Personal Automation

On Windows I use [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/). Main use case: make Outlook more productive by setting up Superhuman-esque shortcuts (quick replies with greetings etc.)
On MacOS/iOS I use [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) and Apple Shortcuts for automation.
